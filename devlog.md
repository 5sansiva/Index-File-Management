So my understanding for this project is that I will be making an interactive program that creates and manages index files. Those index files will contain a B tree. For this project, I am going to implement this project in python. It will be interactive in the sense that the user can input various commands as arguments which performs operations on an index file that is represented by the B tree. I understand that this project will be implemented in one file which is the index file whihc contains all the operations to perform and such. So far, this is my understanding, I shall read more and decide on how to structure my project in another session.

So from before to this session, I haven't thought of anything new in terms of the project with overall development and such. I still probably want to read more and then start working on some basic stuff for the project to really get the gears grinding. This session, I plan on laying out the structure, and user interaction for this project with the command line prompts and such and see where I can go from there. Nothing too crazy or strict in terms of goals, just getting a feel for the project overall.

So far, I am still trying to figure out how the structure should go. Because it is within a B tree, like do I create files which store B trees and all these commands essentially find files and such and perform stuff with that. It is rather confusing but it shouldn't be too bad.

I have added the code for command input and then filled out the fileManager class. Now I have to add some speciics to that class and adjust.
